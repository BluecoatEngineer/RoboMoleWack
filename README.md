This was the first project I did for Portland State University's Android class.
I got in on the first version of the class, which used MIT App Inventor (rather
than jumping straight into Java).  The project criteria was that you had to
have a "mole" icon that moved around the screen, reacted when touched, and it
should keep score.  I got curious about how far I could push App Inventor.
There are a ton of subroutines and processes running to make the game work.
While App Inventor isn't all that useful past learning, I'm a bit proud
of what I got it to do here.

The music is from "C.R.E.A.T.U.R.E.S. 2 - Torture Trouble" on the Commodore 64.
The sound effects are (I think) the Domino's Pizza Noid.  The animations came
from a sprite sheet website, although I cannot remember what game it was from.
I just searched for "mole" and that seemed perfect.  There are a couple
variations of all the sound effects;  it keeps it from getting too repetitive.
It also speeds up slightly, but not too far such that it becomes impossible
to hit; that'd be frustrating and not fun.  The game time happens to be the
exact length of the music, which I think lends it a kind of carnival game
feel.

Feel free to do what you like with it, within the bounds of the standard
MIT license.  Let me know if you find it interesting!
